# Graphs-Adjacency-Matrix

The "Adjacency Nodes" C program prints connections between nodes based on a given student code using recursion, demonstrating graph traversal in C.

The "Adjacency Nodes Using Stack Operations" C program prints node connections based on a student code using a stack data structure. It demonstrates stack implementation and graph traversal in C.

The "Adjacency Matrix" C program creates and displays an undirected graph based on user input. It prompts for the number of nodes and edges, constructs an adjacency matrix and displays it. This demonstrates a basic graph representation using an adjacency matrix in C.
